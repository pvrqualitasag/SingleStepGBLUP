# Replacement
The text specifies a replacement of $0.08$ for the born males and of $0.45$ for the born females. In the parameter files the ratio of sires and dams replaced are given. The following tries to reproduce the replacement numbers

```{r}
nr_male <- 4500
nr_dams <- 45000
pmp <- 0.5   # Proportion of male progeny
sr = 0.4     # Replacement ratio for sires 
dr = 0.2     # Replacement ratio for dams

# replacement for males born per year
nr_males_born <- nr_dams * pmp
nr_male_replaced <- sr * nr_male
nr_male_replaced / nr_males_born
```

```{r}
# replacement for females born per year
nr_females_born <- nr_dams * (1 - pmp)
nr_female_replaced <- dr * nr_dams
nr_female_replaced / nr_females_born
```
