  abstract = {Background: Extending the reference set for genomic predictions in dairy cattle by adding large numbers of cows with genotypes and phenotypes has been proposed as a means to increase reliability of selection decisions for candidates. Methods: In this study, we explored the potential of increasing the reliability of breeding values of young selection candidates by genotyping a fixed number of first-crop daughters of each sire from one or two generations in a balanced and regular system of genotyping. Using stochastic simulation, we developed a basic population scenario that mimics the situation in dual-purpose Fleckvieh cattle with respect to important key parameters. Starting with a reference set consisting of only genotyped bulls, we extended this reference set by including increasing numbers of daughter genotypes and phenotypes. We studied the effects on model-derived reliabilities, validation reliabilities and unbiasedness of predicted values for selection candidates. We also illustrate and discuss the effects of a selected sample and an unbalanced sampling of daughters. Furthermore, we quantified the role of selection with respect to the influence on validation reliabilities and contrasted these to model-derived reliabilities. Results: In the most extended design, with 200 daughters per sire genotyped from two generations, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects were estimated from a reference set of 420,000 cows and 4200 bulls. For this design, the validation reliabilities for candidates reached 80 {\%} or more, thereby exceeding the reliabilities that were achieved in traditional progeny-testing designs for a trait with moderate to high heritability. We demonstrate that even a moderate number of 25 genotyped daughters per sire will lead to considerable improvement in the reliability of predicted breeding values for selection candidates. Our results illustrate that the strategy applied to sample females for genotyping has a large impact on the benefits that can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Dense molecular markers are being used in genetic evaluation for parts of the population. This requires a two-step procedure where pseudo-data (for instance, daughter yield deviations) are computed from full records and pedigree data and later used for genomic evaluation. This results in bias and loss of information. One way to incorporate the genomic information into a full genetic evaluation is by modifying the numerator relationship matrix. A naive proposal is to substitute the relationships of genotyped animals with the genomic relationship matrix. However, this results in incoherencies because the genomic relationship matrix includes information on relationships among ancestors and descendants. In other words, using the pedigree-derived covariance between genotyped and ungenotyped individuals, with the pretense that genomic information does not exist, leads to inconsistencies. It is proposed to condition the genetic value of ungenotyped animals on the genetic value of genotyped animals via the selection index (e.g., pedigree information), and then use the genomic relationship matrix for the latter. This results in a joint distribution of genotyped and ungenotyped genetic values, with a pedigree-genomic relationship matrix H. In this matrix, genomic information is transmitted to the covariances among all ungenotyped individuals. The matrix is (semi)positive definite by construction, which is not the case for the naive approach. Numerical examples and alternative expressions are discussed. Matrix H is suitable for iteration on data algorithms that multiply a vector times a matrix, such as preconditioned conjugated gradients.},

@Article{Misztal2009,
  abstract = {Currently, genomic evaluations use multiple-step procedures, which are prone to biases and errors. A single-step procedure may be applicable when genomic predictions can be obtained by modifying the numerator relationship matrix A to H = A + A$\Delta$, where A$\Delta$ includes deviations from expected relationships. However, the traditional mixed model equations require H-1, which is usually difficult to obtain for large pedigrees. The computations with H are feasible when the mixed model equations are expressed in an alternate form that also applies for singular H and when those equations are solved by the conjugate gradient techniques. Then the only computations involving H are in the form of Aq or A$\Delta$q, where q is a vector. The alternative equations have a nonsymmetric left-hand side. Computing A$\Delta$q is inexpensive when the number of nonzeros in A$\Delta$ is small, and the product Aq can be calculated efficiently in linear time using an indirect algorithm. Generalizations to more complicated models are proposed. The data included 10.2 million final scores on 6.2 million Holsteins and were analyzed by a repeatability model. Comparisons involved the regular and the alternative equations. The model for the second case included simulated A$\Delta$. Solutions were obtained by the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm, which works only with symmetric matrices, and by the bi-conjugate gradient stabilized algorithm, which also works with nonsymmetric matrices. The convergence rate associated with the nonsymmetric solvers was slightly better than that with the symmetric solver for the original equations, although the time per round was twice as much for the nonsymmetric solvers. The convergence rate associated with the alternative equations ranged from 2 times lower without A$\Delta$ to 3 times lower for the largest simulated A$\Delta$. When the information attributable to genomics can be expressed as modifications to the numerator relationship matrix, the proposed methodology may allow the upgrading of an existing evaluation to incorporate the genomic information. {\textcopyright} American Dairy Science Association, 2009.},

@Article{Vandenplas2017,
  abstract = {The aim of this paper was to develop a national single-step genomic BLUP that integrates multi-national genomic estimated breeding values (EBV) and associated reliabilities without double counting dependent data contributions from the different evaluations. Simultaneous use of all data, including phenotypes, pedigree, and genotypes, is a condition to obtain unbiased EBV. However, this condition is not always fully met, mainly due to unavailability of foreign raw data for imported animals. In dairy cattle genetic evaluations, this issue is traditionally tackled through the multiple across-country evaluation (MACE) of sires, performed by Interbull Centre (Uppsala, Sweden). Multiple across-country evaluation regresses all the available national information onto a joint pedigree to obtain country-specific rankings of all sires without sharing the raw data. In the context of genomic selection, the issue is handled by exchanging sire genotypes and by using MACE information (i.e., MACE EBV and reliabilities), as a valuable source of {"}phenotypic{"} data. Although all the available data are considered, these {"}multi-national{"} genomic evaluations use multi-step methods assuming independence of various sources of information, which is not met in all situations. We developed a method that handles this by single-step genomic evaluation that jointly (1) uses national phenotypic, genomic, and pedigree data; (2) uses multi-national genomic information; and (3) avoids double counting dependent data contributions from an animal's own records and relatives' records. The method was demonstrated by integrating multi-national genomic EBV and reliabilities of Brown Swiss sires, included in the InterGenomics consortium at Interbull Centre, into the national evaluation in Slovenia. The results showed that the method could (1) increase reliability of a national (genomic) evaluation; (2) provide consistent ranking of all animals: bulls, cows, and young animals; and (3) increase the size of a genomic training population. These features provide more efficient and transparent selection throughout a breeding program.},
