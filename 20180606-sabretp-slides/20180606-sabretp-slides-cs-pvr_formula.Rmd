## Current Situation

In Swiss dairy cattle breeding, genomic breeding values are estimated using

- marker-effect models (MEM)
- Bayesian regression approach (Bayes $A - C$ and $C_{\pi}$) 
- two-step procedure


## Two-Step

```{r, out.width=720}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/two-step.png")
```


## Information Exchange

In dairy breeds with gene-flow from foreign countries

- Exchange of genotypes
- Phenotypes not exchanged

$\rightarrow$ MEM evaluations based on de-regressed MACE breeding values


## Single Step GBLUP

* In general BLUP is widely accepted in animal breeding
* Genomic BLUP (GBLUP) can be parametrized as MEM and as breeding-value model (BVM)
* In BVM the sum of SNP-effects is modelled as random component $u$
* Legarra et al. (2009) showed single-step GBLUP approach


## Comparison

$$y = Xb + Zu + e$$

$$Var(u) = A\ \sigma_u^2$$

$$u = \left[ \begin{array}{c}u_1 \\ u_2 \end{array}\right]$$
$$Var(u_2) = G$$
$$Var(u_1) = A_{11} + A_{12}A_{22}^{-1}(G-A_{22})A_{22}^{-1}A_{21}$$
$$Cov(u_1,u_2) = A_{12}A_{22}^{-1}G$$
$$\sigma_u^2 = 1$$
