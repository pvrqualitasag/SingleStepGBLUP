## Current Situation

In Swiss dairy cattle breeding, genomic breeding values are estimated using

- marker-effect models (MEM)
- Bayesian regression approach (Bayes $A - C$ and $C_{\pi}$) 
- two-step procedure


## Two-Step

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/two-step.png")
```


## Information Exchange

In dairy breeds with gene-flow from foreign countries

- Exchange of genotypes
- Phenotypes not exchanged

$\rightarrow$ MEM evaluations based on de-regressed MACE breeding values


## Single Step GBLUP

* In general BLUP is widely accepted in animal breeding
* Genomic BLUP (GBLUP) can be parametrized as MEM and as breeding-value model (BVM)
* In BVM the sum of SNP-effects is modelled as random component $u$
* Legarra et al. (2009) and Christensen and Lund (2010) showed single-step GBLUP approach


## Comparison

```{r, eval=!b_is_html_out}

```{r, eval=b_is_html_out, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/SSGBLUP.png")
```


## Combining Information Sources
