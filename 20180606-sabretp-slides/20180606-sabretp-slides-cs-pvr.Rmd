## Current Situation

In Swiss dairy cattle breeding, genomic breeding values are estimated using

- marker-effect models (MEM)
- Bayesian regression approach (Bayes $A - C$ and $C_{\pi}$) 
- two-step procedure


## Two-Step

```{r, out.width=720}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/two-step.png")
```


## Information Exchange

In dairy breeds with gene-flow from foreign countries

- Exchange of genotypes
- Phenotypes not exchanged

$\rightarrow$ MEM evaluations based on de-regressed MACE breeding values


## Single Step GBLUP
